> custom property binding
	-between two components having parent child relationship
	-binds the custom property of component class in view template of parent class.
	-use @input decorator in child component and define poperty there
	- use that property in parent component as attribute in component selector of child class.
	- doing that we can assign any value of parent class in component selector
	-in this way data will flow from parent component to child component...

> custom event binding
	-using *ngModel for two way binding
	-send data from child component to parent component

> services is basically a reusable component.
  api call is made in services .
  always used on components.


> in a module
	-declaration has components
	-imports has module names
	-provides have services, pipe etc whatever we will create
	-bootstrap has the component which will load first

> decorator class automatically gets loaded without creating object.


> viewProvider
.	- to call a class at component level.
.	-this class wont load until its object is created.
.	-this class wont get used/load until the component is used.(kind of merit)...

> if we want to call/use a class at module level ..then provide name in app.module.ts>providers.
	--this class will automatically load when module gets loaded.(kind of demerit, make app slow)
